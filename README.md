# Google-Data-Analytics-project
As part of Google data analytics course I have done a case study on cyclisticts company.
In this scenario, I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, the team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, the team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.
Here I will be using SQL for Analysis.
